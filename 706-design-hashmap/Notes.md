declare a array of size 1000005 as key <= 10000000 and initialize the values at each index by -1
-1 means values is not present for that index(key)
whenever we have to add key value just update value in array at index key.
whenever we have to remove a key value just update the value in array at index key to -1.
Time Complexity = (1) --- average
Space Complexity = O(1000005)
