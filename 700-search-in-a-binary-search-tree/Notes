if current root value is equal to given value then simply return that node.
if current root value is greater than given value then desired node would be in left subtree.
if current root value id less than given value then desired node would be in right subtree.
if current root is NULL then there is no such node whose value equal to given node.
Time Complexity = O(n) ;
Space Complexity = O(Height of Tree) as we are traversing either in left subtree or right subtree based on conditions.
